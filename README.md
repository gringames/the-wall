# the-wall
Small project for the TUM Semester Game Jam 2023 (Topic: _Shapeshift_).

The wall is a top down shooter with three switchable characters, each representing a different shape: Circle, Square and Triangle.
They all have their own weapon, special ability and weight. The heavier an entity, the fewer knockback it receives, so choose carefully who you play.
Over time, enemies of random shapes spawn. 
Bullets do not make damage, but only exert a knockback force on the hit entity. 
Entities bounce of walls, so do bullets. 
At the bottom there is a big hole. The only way to kill an enemy is to knock him in said hole by shooting at him from the right angle.
But there is a twist: A wall spanning across the whole screen regularly moves from the top to the bottom, taking anything with it (player and enemies) that does not match the shape displayed on the wall. 
At this moment you have to switch to the correct shape, otherwise youâ€™ll fall and the game is over.
